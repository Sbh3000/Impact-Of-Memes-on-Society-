# Study: 

This study aims to examine the social impact of memes in society and their influence on individuals' understanding and acceptance of various ideas. Memes, as cultural ideas or behaviors transmitted through various mediums, have become a prevalent topic on the internet. They can be used for purposes such as spreading awareness, supporting or resisting political issues, and entertaining people. However, it is important to recognize that memes can have both positive and negative effects on society. This research will primarily focus on the analysis of memes' impact on social variables, including stereotypes and social awareness. The work of Limor Shifman, author of "Memes in Digital Culture," will serve as a significant foundation for this study, highlighting the legitimacy and significance of memes in contemporary culture.
